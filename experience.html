        <b class="blue">Scrum Master <br> WorkPrecision, Gothenburg Sweden</b> <br>
        <em>React, TypeScript, Python, DigitalOcean, Jira, Bitbucket </em>
        <p>I started as a project manager at WorkPrecision, while still studying.<br> I got an offer to continue after I graduated. It was then decided that we were to adopt Scrum,<br> and more agile methods to reach the product owners' goals. 
          
          There were under-managed dependencies<br> that had to be updated or replaced, and Jira boards had to be changed to be set up correctly, with story points and updated and sorted epics,<br> stories, bugs, and tasks. By the team being more communicative the goals and estimates became more realistic and achieved in the right order.

          <p>February 2022 - May 2022</p>
          <b class="blue">Project Manager / Frontend Developer <br>WorkPrecision Software, Gothenburg Sweden</b> <br>
          <em>React, TypeScript, DigitalOcean, Jira, Bitbucket </em>
          <p>During my intership at WorkPrecision I started as a front end developer and product manager. The first thing that I <br>did was to organise, label and prioritise Jiras. We had a backlog that was outdated and not inline with what the product owner wanted for the MVP. <br>
          A lot of the issues we where experiencing was backend related, and this has been giving me a hunger to deep deeper in the backend for a greater understanding!

            <b class="blue"> Fullstack Developer <br> Job Tip, Gothenburg Sweden</b><br>
            <em>Vue, Laravel, PHP, MySQL</em>
            <p>Had a 10 week intership at Job Tip that was amazing. <br> The frameworks, languages and data bases used was Laravel, PHP, Vue, and Sequel Ace.
              <br>I learned a lot during this intership and had a lot of fun during the whole duration of my intership. 
              <br>We had daily scrum meetings via Zoom, as some developers where located in Poland and Ukraine.
